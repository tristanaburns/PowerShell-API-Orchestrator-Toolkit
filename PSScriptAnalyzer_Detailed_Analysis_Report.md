## 2. DETAILED VIOLATION ANALYSIS

### 2.1 PSUseSingularNouns Violations (33 instances)

#### Critical Functions (HIGH Usage, 4+ calls)
These functions are extensively used across the codebase and require a careful migration strategy:

| Function | File | Usage Count | Files Affected | Suggested Rename |
|----------|------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Add-StandardCredentialParams | tools\NSXConfigSync*.ps1 | 15 calls | 2 files | Add-StandardCredentialParam |

| Get-ConsolidatedResourceTypes | tools\NSXConfigSync*.ps1 | 7 calls | 2 files | Get-ConsolidatedResourceType |
| Get-ManagerCredentials | tools\NSXConfigReset.ps1 | 5 calls | 1 file | Get-ManagerCredential |
| Merge-ConfigurationObjects | tools\NSXConfigSync*.ps1 | 5 calls | 2 files | Merge-ConfigurationObject |
| Show-StoredCredentials | tools\NSXCredentialManager.ps1 | 4 calls | 1 file | Show-StoredCredential |

#### Moderate Impact Functions (MEDIUM Usage, 2-3 calls)
These functions have limited usage and can be updated with coordinated changes:

| Save-ValidatedEndpointsForTools | NSXConnectionTest.ps1 | 2 calls | Save-ValidatedEndpointForTool |
| Test-ConfigurationFiles | VerifyNSXConfiguration.ps1 | 2 calls | Test-ConfigurationFile |

#### Low Impact Functions (LOW Usage, 0-1 calls)
These functions can be safely renamed immediately:

| Function | File | Usage Count | Suggested Rename |
|----------|------|-------------|------------------|
| Filter-ConfigurationByResourceTypes | NSXConfigSync*.ps1 | 1 call | Filter-ConfigurationByResourceType |
| Filter-ConfigurationByDomain | NSXConfigSync*.ps1 | 1 call | Filter-ConfigurationByDomain* |

## 3. PRIORITIZED REMEDIATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)
**Target: LOW RISK internal utilities with minimal usage**

1. **PSScriptAnalyzerUtility.ps1** (9 violations)
   - Rename all Fix-* functions to Repair-*
   - Convert plural nouns to singular
   - Update internal references
   - Test in isolation

2. **Low-usage public functions** (4 violations)
   - Direct rename for functions with 0-1 external calls
   - Update the single reference point

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Risk Level**: VERY LOW

### Phase 2: Moderate Impact (Week 2)
**Target: Functions with 2-3 usage points**

1. Create atomic commits for each function rename
2. Update all references in coordinated changes
3. Test each change individually

**Functions to Update**:
- All credential-related functions in NSXConnectionDiagnostics.ps1
- Service initialization functions in StandardToolTemplate.ps1
- Resource type functions with limited usage

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours
**Risk Level**: LOW-MEDIUM

### Phase 3: High Impact Migration (Weeks 3-4)
**Target: Functions with 4+ usage points**

**Recommended Strategy**: Backward Compatible Migration

```powershell
# Step 1: Create new compliant function
function Get-ManagerCredential {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param($Manager, $NSXManager)
    Get-ManagerCredentials @PSBoundParameters
}

# Step 2: Add deprecation warning to old function
function Get-ManagerCredentials {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param($Manager, $NSXManager)
    
    Write-Warning "Get-ManagerCredentials is deprecated. Use Get-ManagerCredential instead."
    # Original implementation...
}

# Step 3: Update internal calls gradually
# Step 4: Remove deprecated functions in future release
```

**Estimated Effort**: 16-24 hours
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4.1 Immediate Actions (Can be done now)
1. Fix all internal utility functions in PSScriptAnalyzerUtility.ps1
2. Rename functions with zero external usage
3. Update PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1 to exclude unfixable violations

### 4.2 Short-term Actions (Within 1 sprint)
1. Implement wrapper functions for high-usage violations
2. Add deprecation warnings to old function names
3. Update internal documentation
4. Create migration guide for external users

### 4.3 Long-term Actions (Next major release)
1. Complete migration to new function names
2. Remove deprecated function aliases
3. Update all external documentation
4. Communicate breaking changes to users

---

## 5. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### For Functions with External Dependencies
1. **Use Aliases**: Create function aliases for backward compatibility
   ```powershell
   Set-Alias -Name Get-ManagerCredentials -Value Get-ManagerCredential
   ```

2. **Use Suppression**: For functions that cannot be changed
   ```powershell
   [System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage('PSUseSingularNouns', '')]
   ```

3. **Version Management**: Use semantic versioning to signal breaking changes
   - Current: v1.x.x
   - With deprecations: v1.y.x (minor version bump)
   - After removal: v2.0.0 (major version bump)

### Testing Strategy
1. Create comprehensive test suite before changes
2. Test each phase independently
3. Run integration tests after each phase
4. Validate external tool compatibility

---

## 6. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

### Option A: Suppression-Only Approach
- Add suppression attributes to all violations
- No code changes required
- Maintains 100% backward compatibility
- Trade-off: Does not improve code quality

### Option B: New Module Approach
- Create new module with compliant names
- Maintain old module for compatibility
- Gradually migrate users to new module
- Trade-off: Increased maintenance burden

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)
- Fix internal/low-risk functions immediately
- Use wrappers for high-risk functions
- Apply suppressions only where absolutely necessary
- Balance between compliance and compatibility

---

## 7. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Backup current codebase
- [ ] Document all planned changes
- [ ] Notify team/users of upcoming changes
- [ ] Create test cases for affected functions

### During Implementation
- [ ] Create atomic commits for each change
- [ ] Run PSScriptAnalyzer after each change
- [ ] Test functionality after each change
- [ ] Update documentation inline with changes

### Post-Implementation
- [ ] Run full PSScriptAnalyzer scan
- [ ] Execute complete test suite
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes for external tools
- [ ] Update public documentation
- [ ] Create release notes

---

## 8. CONCLUSION

The NSX PowerShell Toolkit has 46 naming convention violations that impact code quality and PowerShell best practices compliance. While many are in public-facing functions that pose refactoring risks, a phased approach can address these issues:

1. **33%** of violations (16) can be fixed immediately with minimal risk
2. **37%** of violations (17) require coordinated but manageable updates
3. **30%** of violations (13) need careful migration strategies

By following the prioritized remediation plan and using backward-compatible migration strategies, the codebase can achieve compliance while minimizing disruption to existing users.

### Expected Outcomes
- Improved code maintainability
- Better PowerShell community standard compliance
- Enhanced discoverability through standard naming
- Clearer API surface for new users

### Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 1 week (Quick wins)
- Phase 2: 1 week (Moderate impact)
- Phase 3: 2 weeks (High impact with testing)
- Total: 4 weeks for complete remediation
