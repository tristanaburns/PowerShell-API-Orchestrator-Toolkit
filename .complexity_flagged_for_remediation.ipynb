        "HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Functional Improvements):\n1. PSReviewUnusedParameter: 68 instances\n   - Impact: Code maintainability and clarity\n   - Risk Level: LOW (most are callback parameters required by .NET API signatures)\n   - Remediation: Review each parameter for actual usage vs API contract requirements",
        "2. PSPossibleIncorrectComparisonWithNull: 47 instances\n   - Impact: Potential logic bugs\n   - Risk Level: MEDIUM (could affect conditional logic)\n   - Remediation: Convert to explicit null checks using $null comparison operators",
        "3. PSUseDeclaredVarsMoreThanAssignments: 45 instances  \n   - Impact: Code clarity and potential logic issues\n   - Risk Level: MEDIUM (variables declared but not used effectively)\n   - Remediation: Review variable usage patterns and eliminate unnecessary declarations",
        "MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (Code Quality):\n4. PSAvoidUsingPositionalParameters: 44 instances\n   - Impact: Code readability and maintainability\n   - Risk Level: LOW (functional but less readable)\n   - Remediation: Convert positional parameters to named parameters",
        "5. PSUseSingularNouns: 33 instances\n   - Impact: PowerShell best practices compliance\n   - Risk Level: LOW (naming convention issue)\n   - Remediation: Rename functions to use singular nouns per PowerShell conventions",
        "6. PSUseApprovedVerbs: 13 instances\n   - Impact: PowerShell best practices compliance\n   - Risk Level: LOW (naming convention issue)\n   - Remediation: Rename functions to use approved PowerShell verbs",
        "=== ISSUES REQUIRING CAREFUL ANALYSIS (Not Safe for Auto-Fix) ===",
        "These issues require manual review because:\n- They may be intentional design decisions\n- They could break existing functionality if changed mechanically\n- They require understanding of business logic context\n- They involve API contracts and interface compliance",
        "SPECIFIC AREAS REQUIRING EXPERT REVIEW:\n- CoreSSLManager.ps1: Callback parameters required by .NET certificate validation API\n- Authentication services: Parameter validation and credential handling patterns\n- API service methods: REST method parameter patterns and error handling\n- Tool scripts: CLI parameter handling and user interaction patterns",
        "=== SAFE IMMEDIATE FIXES ALREADY APPLIED ===",
        "COMPLETED IN THIS QUALITY CHECK:\n- PSAvoidTrailingWhitespace: 131 instances FIXED\n  - All trailing whitespace removed across 51 PowerShell files\n  - NO functionality changes - pure formatting improvement\n  - Immediate impact: Cleaner version control diffs",
        "=== REMAINING ACCEPTABLE ISSUES ===",
        "WRITE-HOST USAGE: 1369 instances (INTENTIONALLY PRESERVED)\n- Location: Primarily in tools/ directory CLI scripts\n- Justification: Appropriate for user-facing command-line tools requiring colored output\n- Status: Not flagged for remediation - correct usage for CLI tools",

Consider creating PSScriptAnalyzer custom rules to exclude acceptable Write-Host usage in tools\n5. Plan incremental remediation to avoid large-scale functional changes"
