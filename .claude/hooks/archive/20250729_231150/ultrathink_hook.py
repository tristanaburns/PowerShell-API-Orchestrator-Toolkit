- Multi-layered thinking processes with Sonnet 4 optimization
- Advanced reasoning chains leveraging 200K context
- Deep context analysis with extended thinking
- Strategic planning enhancement
- Complex problem decomposition
- Enhanced decision-making support
- Sonnet 4 specific optimizations

Environment Variables:
- CLAUDE_ULTRATHINK_ENABLED: Enable/disable ultrathink mode
- CLAUDE_USE_SONNET_4: Enable Sonnet 4 specific features
- CLAUDE_THINKING_MODE: Set thinking depth (ultra, deep, standard)
- CLAUDE_MODEL: Specify Claude model (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- CLAUDE_ADVANCED_REASONING: Enable advanced reasoning features
- CLAUDE_EXTENDED_THINKING: Enable extended thinking capabilities
