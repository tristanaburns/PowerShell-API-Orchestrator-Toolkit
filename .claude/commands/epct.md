# EPCT Development Workflow Command

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:
1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**



## CANONICAL PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT - READ FIRST

**THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY AND MUST BE READ, INDEXED, AND FOLLOWED BEFORE ANY COMMAND EXECUTION**

### 1. PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, YOU MUST:**
1. READ AND INDEX: `./claude/commands/protocol/code-protocol-compliance-prompt.md`
3. VERIFY: User has given explicit permission to proceed
4. ACKNOWLEDGE: ALL CANONICAL PROTOCOL requirements

**FORBIDDEN:** Proceeding without complete protocol compliance verification

### 2. SINGLE BRANCH DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY - MANDATORY

**FOLLOW THE SINGLE BRANCH DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL:**
- ALL git workflows MUST follow the protocol defined in `./claude/commands/protocol/code-protocol-single-branch-strategy.md`
- **SACRED BRANCHES:** main/master/production are protected - NEVER work directly on them
- **SINGLE WORKING BRANCH:** development branch ONLY - work directly on development
- **NO FEATURE BRANCHES:** FORBIDDEN to create feature/fix branches without explicit permission
- **ATOMIC COMMITS:** One logical change per commit with conventional format
- **IMMEDIATE BACKUP:** Push to origin after every commit

### 3. CONTAINERIZED APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS

**FOR CONTAINERIZED APPLICATIONS, YOU MUST:**
1. Build the container after EVERY code change
2. Check container logs for errors/warnings
3. Validate application functionality
4. Ensure all services are healthy
5. Test API endpoints if applicable
6. Verify no regression issues

**IF BUILD/DEPLOY ISSUES OCCUR:**
- Follow debugging protocol in `./claude/commands/code/code-debug.md`
- Use refactoring protocol in `./claude/commands/code/code-refactor.md`
- Apply planning protocol in `./claude/commands/code/code-planning.md`
