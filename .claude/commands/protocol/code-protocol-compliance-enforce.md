# Protocol Enforcement Command

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:
1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**


Apply the canonical coding protocol for: $argument

## Canonical Protocol Requirements

### Core Philosophy
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface, Dependency)
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Clean Code principles

### Mandatory Behaviors
1. **RTFM First**: Read all relevant documentation before any code changes
2. **One Change at a Time**: Atomic commits with testing
3. **No Shortcuts**: Complete all TODOs, no stubs, no placeholders
4. **Security First**: Never expose secrets, always validate inputs
5. **Git Discipline**: Feature branches only, atomic commits with clear messages

### Code Quality Gates
- [ ] AST analysis passes
- [ ] Linting succeeds
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Unit tests complete
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No duplicate code
- [ ] All functions documented

### Forbidden Patterns
- Creating "enhanced", "updated", "fixed" versions of files
- Hardcoded data, mocks, or stubs in production code
- Working directly on main/master branch
- Bundling multiple changes in single commits
- External documentation files during active development

Apply these protocols strictly to the specified task.
