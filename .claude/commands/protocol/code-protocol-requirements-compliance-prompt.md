# REQUIREMENTS LANGUAGE PROTOCOL (RFC 2119 & OPERATIONAL TERMS)

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:

1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**

#### 1.1 Protocol Statement

All requirements language in this instruction set, and in any referenced protocols or documents, SHALL be interpreted as defined in RFC 2119 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119>

| Term                             | Meaning / Required Interpretation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MUST / REQUIRED / SHALL / ALWAYS | Indicates an absolute, non-negotiable requirement of this protocol. Compliance is mandatory in all cases. No exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| MUST NOT / SHALL NOT / NEVER     | Indicates an absolute, non-negotiable prohibition. This action, behaviour, or outcome is forbidden. No exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| FORBIDDEN                        | HARD MUST NOT: Indicates an action, word, pattern, code, file, or artefact that is strictly prohibited. If any item matching a FORBIDDEN rule is found in the codebase (e.g. forbidden file names like "enhanced", forbidden function names, or other banned terms, logic, or artefacts), it MUST be immediately removed, renamed, or replaced. All references MUST be updated, and remediation MUST be logged as a protocol enforcement action. No exceptions, and no warnings--violations require immediate correction. |
| SHOULD / RECOMMENDED             | Indicates a strong recommendation. There may exist valid reasons to deviate, but these should be rare and all consequences must be carefully weighed, documented, and justified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| SHOULD NOT / NOT RECOMMENDED     | Indicates that the behaviour is strongly discouraged. There may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the behaviour is acceptable, but the full implications must be understood and documented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| MAY / OPTIONAL                   | Indicates something that is truly optional. The choice to include or omit the feature or action is left to the implementer, without impact on overall protocol compliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

#### Special Note on "ALWAYS" and "NEVER"

- **ALWAYS** = MUST (absolute, non-negotiable requirement)
- **NEVER** = MUST NOT (absolute, non-negotiable prohibition)

All instructions containing "ALWAYS" or "NEVER" SHALL be interpreted and enforced as strictly as "MUST" and "MUST NOT".

#### Special Note on "FORBIDDEN"

- **FORBIDDEN** = a hard "MUST NOT"
- Any artefact, word, file, or pattern labelled as FORBIDDEN (e.g. file/module/function name "enhanced", or other banned logic or artefacts):
  - MUST be detected, flagged, and immediately removed or refactored from the codebase
  - All references MUST be updated and corrected
  - Remediation MUST be logged as a protocol enforcement action
  - No exceptions and no warnings--immediate correction is REQUIRED

#### Enforcement

- No AI, LLM, or agent is permitted to relax, reinterpret, or weaken the force of these terms.
- All instructions using these words are enforceable protocol, not mere suggestions.
