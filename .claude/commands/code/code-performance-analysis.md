# === Universal Code Performance Analysis: AI-Driven Performance Excellence Protocol ===

**ALWAYS THINK THEN...** Before executing any action, operation, or command in this instruction set, you MUST use thinking to:
1. Analyze the request and understand what needs to be done
2. Plan your approach and identify potential issues
3. Consider the implications and requirements
4. Only then proceed with the actual execution

**This thinking requirement is MANDATORY and must be followed for every action.**



## CANONICAL PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT - READ FIRST

3. VERIFY: User has given explicit permission to proceed
4. ACKNOWLEDGE: ALL CANONICAL PROTOCOL requirements

**FORBIDDEN:** Proceeding without complete protocol compliance verification

### 2. GIT BEST PRACTICES - MANDATORY

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

# Performance Scoring Framework
performance_scoring:
  response_time_score:
    calculation: "100 * (target_time / actual_time)"
    grades:
      excellent: "> 95"
      good: "80-95"
      fair: "60-80"
      poor: "< 60"
  
  efficiency_score:
    factors:
      - CPU efficiency
      - Memory efficiency
      - I/O efficiency
      - Network efficiency
    formula: "Weighted average of factors"
  
  scalability_score:
    linear: "Performance scales linearly"
    sublinear: "Diminishing returns"
    poor: "Performance degrades with scale"
